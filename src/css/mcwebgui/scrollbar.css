::-webkit-scrollbar {
    display: none;
}

/*

IMPORTANT NOTICE:

AT THE MOMENT, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT MINECRAFT BEDROCK EDITION'S SCROLLBAR IN HTML, DUE TO ::before AND ::after NOT BEING SUPPORTED ON THE thumb OF THE SCROLLBAR.
IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT THE VERTICAL SCROLLBAR, DUE TO IT NEEDING A DIFFERENT SPRITESHEET, WHICH ISN'T POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT.
SCROLLBARS WILL NOT EXIST IN MCWEBGUI UNTIL THOSE FEATURES ARE IMPLEMENTED.

---

TEMPORARY SOLUTION PLAN:

WE CAN RECODE THE SCROLLBAR AND BASICALLY REMAKE IT; THAT COULD BE DIFFICULT AND WILL BE DELAYED UNTIL MCWEBGUI 1.1.0.
THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING.
